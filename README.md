# 🧠 Medical Research RAG Assistant

A full-stack Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that answers medical questions using real research literature.

The system retrieves relevant information from curated medical research papers and clinical guidelines, then generates grounded answers using a large language model.

Instead of relying solely on an LLM (which may hallucinate), this system performs **semantic retrieval from trusted medical sources before generating responses**.

# 🚀 Features

* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
* Semantic search over medical research papers
* Answers grounded in retrieved sources
* Source references returned with responses

# 📚 Dataset Sources

The dataset was manually curated from authoritative medical and public health sources.

### Sources Used

1. **Official Clinical Guidelines**

   * World Health Organization (WHO)
   * Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)
   * Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW)

2. **Clinical Management Guidelines**

   * National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)

3. **Research Evidence**

   * Peer-reviewed systematic reviews or meta-analyses
   * Retrieved from PubMed
   * Published after 2018

4. **Public Health and Prevention Guidance**

   * World Health Organization (WHO)
   * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

These documents include clinical guidelines, systematic reviews, and public health advisories.

# 📥 Dataset Download

The dataset contains large PDF files and therefore is **not stored directly in this repository**.

Download it here:

DATASET_LINK_HERE

After downloading, place the files in the project directory:

```text
data/
└── medical_papers/
    ├── hypertension/
    ├── tuberculosis/
    ├── malaria/
    └── ...
```

---

# ⚙️ Backend Setup

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/medical_rag.git
cd medical_rag/backend
```

---

## 2. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate environment:

Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Mac / Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 4. Add Required Files

Place the following generated files inside the backend directory:

```text
backend/
├── faiss_index.bin
└── chunks_metadata.pkl
```

---

## 5. Add API Key

# 🔌 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description                   |
| ------ | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| GET    | `/`      | Health check                  |
| POST   | `/chat`  | Send query and receive answer |

Example request:

```json
{
  "query": "What are the symptoms of tuberculosis?"
}
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "answer": "...generated response...",
  "sources": ["document_1.pdf", "document_2.pdf"]
}
```

# 🧠 How the RAG System Works

1. User submits a question
2. Question is converted into an embedding
3. FAISS retrieves the most relevant text chunks
4. Retrieved context is injected into the prompt
5. The LLM generates a grounded answer using retrieved knowledge

This approach significantly reduces hallucinations and allows querying large research collections.

# ⚠️ Important Notes

The following files are **not included in the repository**:

* faiss_index.bin
* chunks_metadata.pkl
* dataset PDFs

These must be downloaded or generated locally.

---

# 🌐 Deployment

Backend can be deployed on **Render**.

Frontend can be deployed on **Vercel**.

Ensure the backend API URL is updated in the frontend configuration before deployment.

# 🔮 Future Improvements

* Hybrid search (BM25 + vector search)
* Re-ranking models
* Streaming responses
* Conversation memory
* Document filtering
* RAG evaluation metrics
